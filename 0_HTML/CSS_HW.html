                <p> I would really like to visit the country of Australia. Australia is both a country <br> 
                    and a continent; it is also an island, how cool is that? Australia is located in the <br> 
                    southern hemisphere, this means the seasons are during the opposite time of the year <br>
                    compared to New York City. You can experience six different climates in the  country of  <br> 
                    Australia. I donâ€™t think I have ever been to a country like that, I want to also experience  <br>
                    the beauty of the forest and beach in one place.
